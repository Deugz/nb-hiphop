# History

```{note}

What can we put in this section ?

*I like the breaktothebeat idea of splitting things in years, however we will always be missing what is out of the mainstream right ?*

- I am thinking to create two subsections per period:
    - **the mainstream** (what everybody know) with the main artists of that time
    - **the underrated** (with hidden gems) that we and others can implement as we progress in our journey ;)
        - implement DJ Premier soundcloud mix 

```
